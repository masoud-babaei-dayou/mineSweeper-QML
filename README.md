# MineSweeper-QML

A simple implementation of the classic MineSweeper game using QML and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project is a MineSweeper game built with Qt Quick (QML) for the UI and JavaScript for the game logic. It features a 10x10 grid with bombs placed randomly. The user can reveal cells and try to avoid bombs.

## Features

- 10x10 grid layout
- Random bomb placement (7% of the grid)
- Reveal cells by clicking
- Tracks revealed cells and bomb locations
- Basic MineSweeper gameplay mechanics

## Screenshots

*(Add screenshots here if you want)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Qt 5.15 or later (Qt Quick and QML modules)
- Qt Creator IDE (recommended) or any compatible QML runtime environment

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masoud-babaei-dayou/mineSweeper-QML.git```

2. Open the project in Qt Creator.
3. Build and run the project.
4. The MineSweeper window will open and you can start playing.

## Project Structure

- `main.qml` - Main UI and game board layout
- `logic.js` - JavaScript logic for bomb placement and game mechanics

## How It Works

- The grid is created using a QML `Grid` with 10 rows and 10 columns.
- Bombs are randomly placed on the grid (7% of the cells).
- Clicking a cell reveals whether it contains a bomb or not.
- Game tracks revealed cells to prevent re-revealing.
